# Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis

Author:Shashank Mishra  
Objective: Use SQL queries to extract insights from a cleaned defence budget dataset.

This project contains SQL queries that perform analysis on a government defence dataset. The dataset was imported from a CSV into a SQLite database and explored using SQL.
